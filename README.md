In this project, the idea was to take a combination of 9 stocks and ETFs which would have exposure to a combination of "high-risk, high-return", "inflation-hedge" and "general market exposure". In the initial part of the project, I have shown the price performance, volatility, and correlation between these instruments. Later on, I created a simulation engine that would take the financial ratios, especially the Sharpe ratio to showcase the best risk-adjusted return measure during the historical performance. In the scenario of the PDF result, I used 10,000 simulation runs and the current "Risk-free" rate. This can be used to change the number of simulation runs and different risk-free rate and it would return with the best weightage for these 9 instrument in a portfolio, producing the highest return possible.
